# Emacs-Init.el-Configuration
My current init.el configuration for Emacs.

# Dependencies
- Emacs.

# Installation
1. Download this repository as a zip.<br />

2. In your home (~) directory make a .emacs.d directory (if it doesn't exist).<br />

3. Extract the contents of the zip into your .emacs.d directory.<br />

4. Open the init.el with Emacs then M-x package-refresh-contents. It'll give a Y/N prompt. Press Y.<br />
4.5. If no prompt was made, then M-x package-install-selected-packages. A prompt should show up, Y the prompt.<br />

5. Once the packages are finished being installed then relaunch init.el with Emacs and do M-x package-refresh-contents. <br />

6. Now you can open Emacs normally and enjoy.<br />
